# TurboTunnel

TurboTunnel is a simple curses utility that allows the user to easily ssh into another machine without entering the command or remembering a hostname. Technically this isn't necessary if you only use a few remote machines or your host file has been modified with the names of the target machines, but in the immortal words of Raiden, *"Whatever!"*

## Dependencies

Install the following python packages before running:

<pre><code>cursesmenu
</code></pre>

You will also need the `ncurses` library for this to work. Bear in mind that this is a python 3.x app. Also bear in mind that if you stumbled across this repository, you probably don't need this. It's a personal project intended for me only.
